<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->


I’m a passionate e-commerce strategist and customer experience specialist with over 7 years of experience helping online businesses scale efficiently—without sacrificing trust or service quality.

My work sits at the intersection of **technology, operations, and human-centered support**. I’ve partnered with startups and established brands to streamline their Shopify stores, optimize fulfillment workflows, reduce refund rates, and build self-serve support systems that turn one-time buyers into loyal advocates.

Originally trained in English and communication, I combine analytical rigor with empathetic problem-solving—because the best e-commerce experiences aren’t just fast or cheap; they’re **clear, reliable, and respectful**.

When I’m not optimizing stores or automating customer journeys, you’ll find me contributing to open-source tools, exploring UI/UX trends, or sharing insights on building sustainable online businesses.

### What I Believe
> “Quality and client trust are the ultimate metrics of success.”  
> — This principle has guided every project I’ve taken on—and every relationship I’ve built.

Feel free to [reach out](#) if you're launching a store, refining your post-purchase experience, or just want to talk e-commerce strategy. I collaborate with founders who care as much about **customer lifetime value** as they do about conversion rates.

*P.S. You can also find me on [Reddit’s r/ecommerce](https://www.reddit.com/r/ecommerce/)—where I occasionally share honest takes on dropshipping, support automation, and ethical scaling.*
